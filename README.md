1. Streamlit Frontend

The app runs an interactive **Streamlit interface** with two main sections:

- **Left Panel:** Handles initialization, OpenAI API setup, and PDF uploads (or URL-based downloads)
- **Right Panel:** Enables the user to chat with the uploaded papers and explore scientific concepts

All application states (API key, docs, embeddings, chat history) are stored in **Streamlit's session state** for persistence during runtime.
